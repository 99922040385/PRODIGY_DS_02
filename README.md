Titanic Dataset Analysis:-
This project involves exploring the Titanic dataset using Python and various data analysis libraries, such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers on board the Titanic and whether they survived or not.
Cleaning
In the data cleaning phase, we performed the following operations:

Handling missing values:
Age: Missing values were replaced with the median age.
Embarked: Missing values were replaced with the mode (most common value).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Summary Statistics
We displayed the summary statistics of the dataset using df.describe().

Data Overview
We displayed the first few rows of the dataset to get an overview of its structure using df.head().

Data Information
We printed information about the dataset, including data types and non-null counts using print(df.info()).

Data Visualization
We used data visualization techniques to explore relationships and patterns in the dataset:

Survival by Sex: We created a count plot to visualize survival by gender.
Survival by Passenger Class: We created a count plot to visualize survival by passenger class.
Survival by Age: We used a histogram to visualize the age distribution of survivors and non-survivors.
Survival by Fare: We used a histogram to visualize the fare distribution of survivors and non-survivors.
Correlation Heatmap: We generated a heatmap to visualize the correlation between various numerical features and survival.
Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into the Titanic dataset, including the distribution of passengers, relationships between variables, and patterns related to survival. Notable findings include the higher survival rate among females, first-class passengers, children, and passengers who paid higher fares.

These insights can serve as a foundation for further analysis or machine learning models aimed at predicting passenger survival. Feel free to explore and expand upon this analysis to gain deeper insights into the data.
